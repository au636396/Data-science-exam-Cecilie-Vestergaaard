This markdown includes Model 1: Animal type, age, breed, Trained on the regular data, the 3 outcome values, and the "even" dataset. At the end there's the code used for mamking the visualizations of the tree model

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  xgboost,
  tidyverse,
  caret,
  DiagrammeR,
)
```


```{r}
#read in the clean data set
bigdf<- read_csv("data/clean_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```


```{r}
# getting the needed coulmns 
df <- bigdf[c('animal_type', 'breed', "age_upon_intake_(years)", 'time_in_shelter_weeks')]

# checking the classes of the data and changing when necessary
class(df$animal_type) #character
class(df$breed) #character
class(df$`age_upon_intake_(years)`) #numeric
class(df$time_in_shelter_weeks) #numeric

df$animal_type <- as.factor(df$animal_type)
df$breed <- as.factor(df$breed)
df$`age_upon_intake_(years)` <- as.factor(df$`age_upon_intake_(years)`)

#this remakes the time variable to be in increments of one, before there where some number of weeks no animal was in, which caused trouble for our model
df$time_in_shelter_weeks <- as.factor(df$time_in_shelter_weeks)
df$time_in_shelter_weeks <- as.numeric(df$time_in_shelter_weeks)
```

Split the data for training and testing (80/20 split)
The training data set is used to fit the model, and the testing data set is held out for validation. This allows us to validate the performance of our model (“hold one out cross-validation”).
```{r}
# createDataPartition() function from the caret package to split the original dataset into a training and testing set and split data into training (80%) and testing set (20%)
parts <- createDataPartition(df$time_in_shelter_weeks, p = 0.8, list = F)
train <- df[parts, ]
test <- df[-parts, ]

train_data <- data.matrix(train[,-4])                  # independent variables for train, here the variables of the trees
train_label <- train[,4]                                # dependent variables for train, here the speises of tree
  
test_data <- data.matrix(test[,-4])                    # independent variables for test, here the variables of the trees
test_label <- test[,4]  

# the the dependent variables needs to be vectores not dataframes for the xgb matrix function to accept them
train_label <- train_label$time_in_shelter_weeks
test_label <- test_label$time_in_shelter_weeks

```

Create the xgb.DMatrix objects
```{r}
# Transform the two data sets into xgb.Matrix
xgb_train <- xgb.DMatrix(data=train_data,label=train_label)
xgb_test <- xgb.DMatrix(data=test_data,label=test_label)
```

Define the main parameters

The multi:softprob objective tells the algorithm to calculate probabilities for every possible outcome, for every observation.
```{r}
# Define the parameters for multinomial classification
time <- as.factor(df$time_in_shelter_weeks)
num_class <- length(levels(time))+1

params <- list(
  booster = "gbtree",
  eta = 0.04,
  max_depth = 10,
  gamma = 0.01,
  nthread = 4,
  subsample = 0.75,
  alpha = 1,
  colsample_bytree = 1,
  objective = "multi:softprob",
  eval_metric = "mlogloss",
  num_class = num_class
)
```

Train the model, This is commented out as the model has already been run and saved, it is loaded in in the next chunk  
```{r}
# # Train the XGBoost classifer
# model = xgb.train(
#   params = params,
#   data = xgb_train,
#   nrounds = 50,
#   early_stopping_rounds = 10,
#   watchlist = list(val1=xgb_train, val2=xgb_test),
#   verbose = 1

#xgb.save(model, 'models/model_1_weeks')
model <- xgb.load('models/model_1_weeks')
```


```{r}
# Predict outcomes with the test data
xgb_pred = predict(model,test_data,reshape=T)
xgb_pred = as.data.frame(xgb_pred)
colnames(xgb_pred) = levels(time)

# Identify the class with the highest probability for each prediction
# Iterate over the predictions and identify the label (class) with the highest probability.
# Use the predicted label with the highest probability
xgb_pred$prediction <- apply(xgb_pred, 1, function(x) colnames(xgb_pred)[which.max(x)])
xgb_pred$label <- levels(time)[test_label] 

# Calculate the accuracy of the predictions. This compares the true labels from the test data set with the predicted labels (with the highest probability), and it represents the percent of times that were accuracy predicted using the XGBoost model. 
xgb_pred$prediction <- as.numeric(xgb_pred$prediction)
xgb_pred$prediction <- xgb_pred$prediction -1

# Calculate the final accuracy
result = sum(xgb_pred$prediction == xgb_pred$label)/nrow(xgb_pred)
print(paste("Final Accuracy =",sprintf("%1.2f%%", 100*result)))
```

Split the data for training and testing (80/20 split)
The training data set is used to fit the model, and the testing data set is held out for validation. This allows us to validate the performance of our model (“hold one out cross-validation”).

```{r}
# createDataPartition() function from the caret package to split the original dataset into a training and testing set and split data into training (80%) and testing set (20%)
parts2 <- createDataPartition(df2$trinary, p = 0.80, list = F)
train2 <- df2[parts2, ]
test2 <- df2[-parts2, ]

train_data2 <- data.matrix(train2[,-4])                  # independent variables for train
train_label2 <- train2[,4]                               # dependent variables for train
  
test_data2 <- data.matrix(test2[,-4])                    # independent variables for test

train_label2 <- train_label2$trinary

Create the xgb.DMatrix objects
```{r}
# Transform the two data sets into xgb.Matrix
xgb_train2 <- xgb.DMatrix(data=train_data2,label=train_label2)
xgb_test2 <- xgb.DMatrix(data=test_data2,label=test_label2)
```

Define the main parameters
XGBoost, like most other algorithms, works best when its parameters are hypertuned for optimal performance. The algorithm requires that we define the booster, objective, learning rate, and other parameters. This example uses a set of parameters that I found to be optimal through simple cross-validation. You’ll need to spend most of your time in this step; it’s imperative that you understand your data and use cross-validation.


The multi:softprob objective tells the algorithm to calculate probabilities for every possible outcome (in this case, a probability for each of the three flower species), for every observation.
```{r}
# Define the parameters for multinomial classification
time2 <- as.factor(df2$trinary)
num_class2 <- length(levels(time2))+1


params2 <- list(
  booster = "gbtree",
  eta = 0.05,
  max_depth = 10,
  gamma = 0.01,
  nthread = 4,
  subsample = 0.75,
  alpha = 1,
  colsample_bytree = 1,
  objective = "multi:softprob",
  eval_metric = "mlogloss",
  num_class = num_class2
)
